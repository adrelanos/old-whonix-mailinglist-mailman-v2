<PRE>Hi,

[can you please decide what mailing-list this discussion should happen
on, and then we can stop cross-posting over 4 mailing-list?]

&gt;<i> But I think location aware Tor entry guards (LATEG) are wrong headed.
</i>&gt;<i> The topic of LATEG is so difficult to explain to the user, that as you
</i>&gt;<i> plan, you cannot add it the the UI. Perhaps buried under an advanced
</i>&gt;<i> setting, but that's not worth so much. So it cannot be manual by
</i>&gt;<i> default. Only automatic.
</i>
I agree.

&gt;<i> Which brings me to the issue.
</i>
&gt;<i> There is a reason, why Tor picks a Tor entry guard and sticks to it. By
</i>&gt;<i> changing it more often than Tor would do, you are subverting the reason
</i>&gt;<i> for using Tor entry guards in the first place. In a sense, you are to a
</i>&gt;<i> small degree thereby becoming a Tor developer, and modifying Tor's relay
</i>&gt;<i> choosing algorithm.
</i>
I think I see what you mean, and indeed it's the kind of things about
which my self-confidence is pretty low, and I'd personally rather
avoid fiddling with things I don't understand.

But the thing is: by using random guards every time Tails starts, we
are _already_ making the very same kind of decisions. Only, we are
making it very badly, and this has been going on for too many years
already.

Let's face it: as distro integrators, in the current state of things,
we have to make a decision to compensate for the fact that Tor's guard
selection wasn't designed with our threat model in mind.
Keeping things as-is would be a decision. Using fully persistent entry
guards (not location aware), like Tor Browser users get currently,
would be another decision. We cannot escape it, so we're trying to
make this decision in a way that's much better for the vast majority
of Tails users.

&gt;<i> I wonder, if the whole LATEG thing would not be much better implemented
</i>&gt;<i> in Tor itself. If so, then any (further) research of the entry guard
</i>&gt;<i> topic would still apply to Tails, and not to Tor only.
</i>
With my (lazy by design) distro integrator's hat, I can only agree:
the more work is done by little-t-tor, the less I have to deal with
myself, and the more is shared cross-distro. Yay.

However, taking a step back, I'm not sure it makes a whole lot of
sense: to be location-aware, tor would have to gain knowledge about
new concepts, and interface with OS services, that it can currently
happily ignore so far; add to this that tor is multi-platform;
I expect it's not an easy problem to deal with at this specific place,
but again: if someone solves it, I certainly won't complain :)

&gt;<i> The documentation advice for advanced users caring about AdvGoalTracking
</i>&gt;<i> could be to use obfuscated [private] bridges and to alternate
</i>&gt;<i> them per travel location.
</i>
Right, I think it's important that people who what more control can
get it this way, and IIRC our current best proposal does not prevent
anyone from doing this.

&gt;<i> Or perhaps you might be able to explain in tor-launcher /
</i>&gt;<i> anon-connection-wizard [1] [2] [3] the LATEG / AdvGoalTracking issue.
</i>
If the configuration GUI has good facilities to document a broad and
complex problem, yay, bringing the doc closer to the software is
probably a winning strategy.

&gt;&gt;<i> [...] By adding the SSID, we prevent attackers from being able to
</i>&gt;&gt;<i> spoof only the MAC address of the router to reuse a given Tor state;
</i>&gt;&gt;<i> they also have to spoof the SSID which is visible to the user and might
</i>&gt;&gt;<i> be detected as malicious. [...]
</i>
&gt;<i> I find it unlikely, that users might judge an often changing SSID
</i>&gt;<i> malicious. FreeWifi832458252823523 vs FreeWifi358235892435. How many
</i>&gt;<i> users are going to remember that? I would guess, they would just click
</i>&gt;<i> through whatever hoops required to make the WiFi connect again.
</i>
I have no time/energy to think seriouly about it now, and I've been
postponing my reply for a month due to this, so I'll try to be
pragmatic: I'm adding this as a FIXME on our blueprint, and will come
back to it later.

I'm not sure I understand the problem you mean to raise, though.
Can you please elaborate what problem you see if users do exactly this
(&quot;click through whatever hoops required to make the WiFi connect
again&quot;, which I agree is very likely)?

Thanks!

Cheers,
